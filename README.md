Data Modelling Method for Big Data Warehousing Systems
# Rule application flowcharts for a Big Data Modelling method

This repository holds a collection of flowcharts with the recommended steps for applying a set of rules that compose an agile **data modelling method** for Big Data Warehouses. The work is based on a proposal by Santos & Costa (2019) for the general design and implementation of Big Data Warehouses. Full reference to this proposal can be found on:
```bash
Santos, M.Y., Costa, C.: Big Data: Concepts, Warehousing and Analytics. (2019).
```
The data modelling method targets the semi-automatic identification of adequate data models for Big Data Warehousing systems by executing rules for the translation of common traditional relational data models into the era of Big Data, to a model that follows the guidelines and good-practices of Santos & Costa's Big Data Warehousing data modelling general method.

## Method Rules
The seven rules that comprise the method are listed below. This repository hosts a file for each rule with a detailed flowchart on how to apply the rule to a relational data model. Rule application should be sequential and repeated until no changes occur to the model within one full execution.

* R1 - Proposing objects of the type Date, Time and Spatial Object.
* R2 - Proposing objects of type Analytical Object.
* R3 - Proposing Denormalized Objects.
* R4 - Proposing Multiple Denormalized Objects.
* R5 - Proposing Standardized Objects.
* R6 - Proposing Autonomous Objects.
* R7 - Proposing objects of type Complementary Analytical Object.
